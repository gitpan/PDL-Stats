PDL-Stats

This is a collection of statistics modules in Perl Data Language, with a quick-start guide for non-PDL people.

They make perldl--the simple shell for PDL--work like a teenie weenie R, but with PDL threading--"the fast (and automagic) vectorised iteration of 'elementary operations' over arbitrary slices of multidimensional data"--on procedures including t-test, ordinary least squares regression, and kmeans.

Of course, they also work in perl scripts.

VERSION

0.2.0

DEPENDENCIES

PDL
    Perl Data Language. Preferably installed with a Fortran compiler. A few methods (logistic regression and all plotting methods) will only work with a Fortran compiler and some methods (ordinary least squares regression and pca) work much faster with a Fortran compiler.

GSL
    GNU Scientific Library. This is required by PDL::Stats::Distr and PDL::GSL::CDF, and provides p-values for PDL::Stats::GLM.

INSTALLATION

To install all included modules, run the following commands in the current dir:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

After installing, you can find documentation for the modules with the
